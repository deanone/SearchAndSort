Native C++ implementations of typical search and sort algorithms.

At this point, the following algorithms have been implemented:

1. Search:

	1. Linear search
	2. Binary search

2. Sort
	
	1. Bubblesort
	2. Insertion sort
	3. Quicksort

Compile:

./compile.sh

Run:

./sas.out argv[1]

where argv[1] can be one of the following:

	1. linear_search: for the linear search algorithm
	2. binary_search: for the binary search algorithm
	3. bubble_sort: for the bubblesort sort algorithm
	4. insertion_sort: for the insertion sort algorithm
	5. quicksort: for the quicksort algorithm

Example:

	./sas.out binary_search
